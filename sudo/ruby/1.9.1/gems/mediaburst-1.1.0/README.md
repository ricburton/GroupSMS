# Mediaburst API Gem

The Mediaburst Gem is the fastest way of integrating the [Mediaburst API][2] into your own ruby applications.

## Installation

Install the gem as normal:

    sudo gem install mediaburst

The Mediaburst gem also relies on [Nokogiri][1] for XML parsing.

## Usage

Create an instance of the Mediaburst client:

    client = Mediaburst::API.new('username', 'password')

Send an SMS:

    response = client.send_message('441234567890', 'My test message')

Send a message to several numbers:

    response = client.send_message(['441234567890', '441234567891', '441234567892'], 'My test message')

Send a long message to several numbers using the [concat option][8]:

    options = {
      :concat => 3
    }
    
    response = client.send_message(['441234567890', '441234567891', '441234567892', '44'], SOME_LONG_MESSAGE, options)

Send a long message with a custom from address [from option][9]:

    options = {
      :concat => 3,
      :from => 'RubyDemo'
    }

    response = client.send_message(['441234567890', '441234567891', '441234567892', '44'], SOME_LONG_MESSAGE, options)

Check the response for errors:

    y response
    => ---
       "441234567890": true
       "441234567891": true
       "441234567892": true
       "44": 10

On error, the value of the key referenced by the number will equal the [error code][5] returned from Mediaburst.

### Checking the Account's Credit

Create an instance of the Mediaburst client:

    client = Mediaburst::API.new('username', 'password')

Request the credit amount

    client.get_credit
    => "150"

Given invalid credentials, this method will return nil. If the server responds with anything other than a 200, a Mediaburst::ServerError exception is raised.
